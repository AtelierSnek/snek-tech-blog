# Salary/Pay Transparency

This page lists every job we have ever held in tech, inspired by
[Xe's salary transparency](https://xeiaso.net/salary-transparency) page. They set an admirable example, and we'd like to
follow suit, as the more data pay/salary data exists, the more others can reason about their own situations.

## Salary Data
Data on this page is sourced from contracts, emails, and other communication with employers.
We do our best to ensure that this information is up-to-date and accurate.

 - quit a job,
 - get a raise at the same company,
 - change position at the same company,
 - are converted from contract to full-time,
 - other unspecified things happen.

## Your Turn!
**(Ashe)** Please consider also publishing your salary/pay data. The more information is out there in the open,
the better equipped everyone is to handle pay negotiation and the more likely we are to ensure that everyone is paid fairly.

**(Selene)** By sharing this information publicly and unabashedly, we can end the stigmas around discussing pay
and renumeration. These stigmas serve only to leave people in the dark and unable to argue for their own worth.

**(Octavia)** As they say, the light of day is the best disinfectant.
